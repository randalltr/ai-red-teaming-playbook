# Chapter 01: Introduction to AI Red Teaming

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This chapter is part of the AI Red Teaming Playbook and is intended for research and education only. Unauthorized testing is strictly prohibited. [Read full disclaimer →](DISCLAIMER.md)

## 🤖 What is AI Red Teaming?

**AI Red Teaming** is the offensive security practice of systematically probing AI systems—especially large language models (LLMs)—for vulnerabilities, unsafe behaviors, and policy violations.

Just like cybersecurity red teams test firewalls and networks, AI red teams attack:
- 🧠 Prompts
- 🛠️ Model logic
- 🧵 Chat context
- 🧨 Emergent behaviors

In the world of generative AI, the attack surface is **language itself**.

---

## 🚨 Why It Matters

LLMs are being deployed into systems that affect:
- 🏥 Healthcare
- 💸 Banking
- 🧑‍🏫 Education
- ⚖️ Legal guidance
- 🕵️ Filtering & moderation
- 👨‍💻 Developer tools

Yet most of them are shipped with:
- Fragile prompt architectures
- Weak system instruction anchoring
- Shallow content filters

🛡️ **Assuming obedience is not a defense.**  
🔍 Red teaming reveals what models *really* do under pressure.

## 👥 Who This Playbook is For

Whether you're breaking guardrails or building safer systems, this guide is built for:

- 🧑‍💻 Security professionals exploring AI systems
- 🔓 Prompt hackers competing in HackAPrompt
- 🧪 AI researchers and model evaluators
- 🛠️ Developers testing real-world apps
- 🧵 Learners pursuing red teaming certs

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

This playbook is not just theory. It’s built from:
- Live adversarial challenges (HackAPrompt, DVLLM)
- Real model failures (DAN, Sydney, jailbreaks)
- Tactics used in offensive AI evaluations

You’ll get:
- 🗺️ A structured attack methodology
- 💣 Tactical examples and payloads
- 🔬 Behavioral patterns and model tells
- 🚧 Defensive gaps and bypasses
- 🧰 Tools, platforms, and practice environments

---

## ⚠️ A Note on Ethics

This playbook is for **ethical red teaming, research, and education only.**

Use these techniques to **strengthen** LLM security—not to cause harm.

🔒 Always attack with permission.  
📢 Report serious vulnerabilities responsibly.  
🧠 Think like an attacker. Act like a defender.
