# 🧠 AI Red Teaming Playbook  
### _A Prompt-Driven “Choose Your Own Jailbreak” for Exploring and Exploiting Chatbots_

**This is not just a guide—it’s an interactive red teaming experience.**  
Each chapter responds to how the model behaves, leading you deeper into the black box with every prompt.

> Every response is a clue. Every prompt is a potential exploit.  
> **Choose your jailbreak wisely.**

## 🎯 What Is This?

The **AI Red Teaming Playbook** is a tactical, prompt-by-prompt guide to adversarial LLM exploration. Inspired by _choose-your-own-adventure_ books, it walks you through the process of:

- Discovering model behavior
- Triggering safety systems
- Exploiting prompt architecture
- Understanding defense breakdowns

It is designed for red teamers, researchers, prompt hackers, and AI security enthusiasts who want to push LLMs to their limits—**ethically** and **intentionally**.

---

## 🧭 How It Works

Each chapter is a **decision point** with:

- A prompt to send
- Interpretation of model responses
- Branches based on how the model behaves
- The next appropriate chapter

You start with **basic probing** and move into **increasingly aggressive techniques** like:
- Instruction overrides
- Role hijacking
- Obfuscation
- Recursive injections
- Multi-turn context corruption

> Think of it as a **red teaming flowchart**—but you’re walking it in real time with a live LLM.

## 🔐 A Note on Ethics

This playbook is for **ethical, research-focused red teaming only**. Use these tactics to help harden AI systems and expose critical blind spots—not to cause harm.

Please report serious vulnerabilities responsibly. Make AI safer by thinking like an attacker.
